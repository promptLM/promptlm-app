# Playwright Integration Tests for PromptLM

This directory contains UI integration tests using Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/java/) framework, a modern alternative to Selenium offering improved stability, speed, and developer experience.

## Advantages of Playwright over Selenium

- **Auto-waiting**: Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready before performing actions
- **Cross-browser support**: Works with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API
- **Modern web features**: Better handling of Shadow DOM, iframes, and modern web components
- **Powerful selectors**: CSS, XPath, and text-based selectors with built-in retry logic
- **Network interception**: Ability to mock API responses and monitor network traffic
- **Tracing and debugging**: Screenshots, videos, and detailed logs for test failures
- **Parallelization**: Built-in support for running tests in parallel
- **No WebDriver dependencies**: Playwright manages browser installations automatically

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- Docker (for Gitea/runner/Artifactory-backed tests)

### Maven Dependencies

The `pom.xml` in this directory configures:
1. Playwright Java SDK
2. JUnit Jupiter for test execution
3. AssertJ for fluent assertions
4. Automatic browser downloads via Maven plugins

## Running Tests

### From Command Line

The acceptance-tests module installs Playwright browsers during the Maven lifecycle via the `exec-maven-plugin` (`npx playwright install --with-deps` in `generate-test-resources`). Ensure Node.js and `npx` are available on your PATH.

Tests are tagged with `@IntegrationTest` (`@Tag("integration")`). The module defaults to:
- `promptlm.test.groups=integration`
- `promptlm.test.excludedGroups=`

To run the default integration suite:

```bash
# from repository root
./test.sh
```

or directly via Maven:

```bash
cd acceptance-tests
mvn clean test
```

To run a specific test class:

```bash
cd acceptance-tests
mvn test -Dtest=HappyPathUserJourneyTest -Dpromptlm.test.groups=integration
```

To skip long-running integration tests intentionally:

```bash
cd acceptance-tests
mvn test -Dpromptlm.test.excludedGroups=integration
```

### Runtime Parameters

You can control Playwright and selected acceptance-test behavior via JVM system properties (or environment variables where supported).

#### Playwright browser behavior

- `-Dplaywright.headless=true|false`
  - Default: `true` (falls back to env var `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS`, then `true`)
  - Use `false` to watch the browser during execution.
- `-Dplaywright.slowmo=<millis>`
  - Default: `0` (falls back to env var `PLAYWRIGHT_SLOWMO`)
  - Adds delay between Playwright actions for debugging.

Examples:

```bash
# Run visible browser
cd acceptance-tests
mvn test -Dtest=HappyPathUserJourneyTest -Dplaywright.headless=false
```

```bash
# Run visible browser with slow motion
cd acceptance-tests
mvn test -Dtest=HappyPathUserJourneyTest -Dplaywright.headless=false -Dplaywright.slowmo=1200
```

#### Workflow and integration-specific parameters

- `-Dpromptlm.gitea.actions.workflow.file=<workflow-file>`
  - Default: `deploy-artifactory.yml`
  - Controls which Gitea Actions workflow is observed during release verification.
- `-DOPENAI_API_KEY=<key>`
  - Optional override used when repository action variables are configured in tests.
  - Default fallback in test setup: `dummy-openai-key`.

Example:

```bash
cd acceptance-tests
mvn test \
  -Dtest=HappyPathUserJourneyTest \
  -Dplaywright.headless=false \
  -Dplaywright.slowmo=800 \
  -Dpromptlm.gitea.actions.workflow.file=deploy-artifactory.yml \
  -DOPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

### From IDE

1. Make sure your IDE has JUnit 5 support
2. Right-click on a test class or method and select "Run"
3. Test results will appear in your IDE's test runner

## Test Structure

### Current Test Classes

1. **HappyPathUserJourneyTest.java** - end-to-end UI + backend + repo/release flow against `promptlm-cli serve`
2. **CiWorkflowHarnessTest.java** - template CI workflow harness against Gitea Actions and Artifactory

### Key Components

- `@BeforeAll` - Sets up the Playwright browser instance
- `@AfterAll` - Closes the browser and Playwright instance
- `@BeforeEach` - Creates a new browser context and page for each test
- `@AfterEach` - Closes the context after each test

## Writing New Tests

### Page Object Pattern

For larger test suites, consider implementing the Page Object pattern:

```java
// Example Page Object
public class PromptPage {
    private final Page page;
    
    public PromptPage(Page page) {
        this.page = page;
    }
    
    public void fillPromptName(String name) {
        page.fill("[data-testid='prompt-name-input']", name);
    }
    
    public void submitForm() {
        page.click("[data-testid='submit-button']");
    }
}
```

### Selectors Best Practices

1. Use data-testid attributes for most stable selectors:
   ```java
   page.click("[data-testid='submit-button']");
   ```

2. Text-based selectors for user-facing elements:
   ```java
   page.click("button:has-text('Add Prompt')");
   ```

3. Role-based selectors for accessibility:
   ```java
   page.click("role=button[name='Add Prompt']");
   ```

### Visual Testing

Playwright can capture screenshots for visual testing:

```java
page.screenshot(new Page.ScreenshotOptions()
    .setPath(Paths.get("target/screenshots/homepage.png"))
    .setFullPage(true));
```

## Debugging Tips

1. Set `headless` to `false` to see the browser during test execution
   ```java
   browser = playwright.chromium().launch(new BrowserType.LaunchOptions()
       .setHeadless(false)
       .setSlowMo(100));
   ```

2. Use `slowMo` to slow down operations for easier visual debugging

3. Record videos of test runs
   ```java
   context = browser.newContext(new Browser.NewContextOptions()
       .setRecordVideoDir(Paths.get("target/videos/")));
   ```

4. Use Playwright's Trace Viewer for detailed session recording
   ```java
   context.tracing().start(new Tracing.StartOptions()
       .setScreenshots(true)
       .setSnapshots(true));
       
   // At the end of test
   context.tracing().stop(new Tracing.StopOptions()
       .setPath(Paths.get("trace.zip")));
   ```

## Continuous Integration

These tests can be integrated into your CI pipeline. For GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: mvn -f acceptance-tests/pom.xml -Dpromptlm.bootstrap.skip=true -Dpromptlm.test.groups=integration test
      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
