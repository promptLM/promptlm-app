/**
 * Placeholder spec used to verify the scaffolding lands correctly.
 *
 * This spec exists so that {@code npx playwright test --list} exits 0 on a
 * fresh checkout — Playwright treats "no tests found" as an error. The spec
 * intentionally asserts only on local values so it never depends on the
 * BackendFixture, the web app, or any network. It will be deleted in a
 * follow-up step once the first real smoke spec lands (see issue #251).
